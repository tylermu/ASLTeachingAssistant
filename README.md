# ASL Teaching Assistant

A program built to teach others how to sign using ASL

## Description

This web application uses handfree.js to track the users hand and displays a visible wireframe around the hand. The user can then use their hand, and one of the provided ASL signs (A, B, or C) to test whether their hand is in the correct position to sign the current sign. A question mark in the top right is provided to answer any questions the user might have.
